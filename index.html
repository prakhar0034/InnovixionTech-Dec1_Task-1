            <h2>Crime Detection using ML</h2>
            <p>Crime Detection using Machine Learning (ML) involves the application of algorithms to analyze patterns and data associated with criminal activities. ML models can be trained on historical crime data to identify trends, predict potential hotspots, and assist law enforcement in proactive measures. By leveraging features like location, time, and types of offenses, ML algorithms can help detect anomalies or unusual patterns that may indicate criminal behavior. This technology holds the potential to enhance crime prevention, resource allocation, and overall public safety through data-driven insights and predictive analytics.</p>
